1. in terminal, activate the conda base you want this package to be in:

2. install new tensorflow with the code below
```
conda install -c apple tensorflow-deps
pip install tensorflow-macos
pip install tensorflow_hub
pip install tensorflow-metal

```

3. check in python script if the new gpu is available
```
from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
print(device_lib.list_local_devices())
```
if you're on a jupyter notebook and it's not showing up, you might have to restart your kernel

you should get an output that looks someting like this
```

if only the CPU shows up, it was not successful
