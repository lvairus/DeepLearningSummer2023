You first need to have an account with ALCF, the Argonne Facility, the place that owns the supercomputer we want to use. Haky signed us up for it

We got an email with instructions on how to set up a password for logging into the supercomputer. We do this using the MobilePass+ app (careful not to use the MobilePass app that doesn't have a + at the end). Enter a pin for the mobile pass app.

Once you have the pass set up, it will provide you with passwords that change each time you use it.

### Log in on terminal app

open terminal

to use the ssh key (i don't know what ssh is)

`ssh <username>@<ALCF_compute_system_name>.alcf.anl.gov`

for me I would type `lvairus@polaris.alcf.anl.gov`

it will then prompt you for a password. This will be the 8 digit code MobilePass+ provides you in big numbers after you enter your pin. do not put a space between the numbers in your passcode.

After that you should be in the super computer. Please code responsibly as that is property of the federal government

To leave the super computer just type

`exit`

### Log in on VSCode (first time)

Open VSCode

Install the extension called "Remote - SSH"

Once it's installed, click the button on the bottom left of the window

This gives you a prompt at the top of the window

select "Connect to Host..."

then "+ Add New SSH Host..."

like terminal, enter `ssh <username>@<ALCF_compute_system_name>.alcf.anl.gov`

a window will pop up at the bottom right of your screen, click the "Connect" button. This will take you to a new VSCode window

click the first option

It will prompt you to enter your passcode, get it from MobilePass+ and enter it

You should be in :)

### Note:

when you first enter polaris you are in what's called the "login node." To run code, you will need to be in a "computing code" which we will go over how to do

## Conda on Polaris

Polaris has its own conda env that you can use

In your polaris login node:

Load the conda env

`module load conda/2023-01-10-unstable`

activate the base

`conda activate base`

Make sure you're standing in your home directory

`mkdir -p venvs/polaris/2023-01-10`

create a virtual environment

`python3 -m venv venvs/polaris/2023-01-10 --system-site-packages`

activate the env

`source venvs/polaris/2023-01-10/bin/activate\`

upgrade pip and do something with "setuptools wheel"

`python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`

you're now free to pip install packages as needed into an isolated env with

`python3 -m pip install <package>`

:)

## Requesting Compute Node

As I said before, you start at a login node and must get to a compute node to run code. if you run code on the login node they'll kick you out (?)

`qsub -I -A AIHPC4EDU -l walltime=1:00:00 -l filesystems=home:grand -q debug`

you might have to replace `AIHPC4EDU` and `-q debug` with something else, ask Haky

it takes a minute to get you to the compute node

Once you're there, you're in a new computer so you'll have to activate your envs again

load conda

`module load conda/2023-01-10-unstable`

activate conda base

`conda activate base`

activate your venv

`source venvs/polaris/2023-01-10/bin/activate`

### Using Jupyter Notebook

get your ip address

`my_ip_address=$( ip rule | grep -w '0:' | awk '{print $3;exit}' )`

print your ip address

`echo $my_ip_address`

`jupyter-notebook --no-browser --ip=$my_ip_address --port=15005 # should be between 15000 and 30000`
